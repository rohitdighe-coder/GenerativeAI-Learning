## ** Prompting Frameworks**



A prompting framework is a predefined structure or template that helps you write prompts systematically — so your instructions are clear, complete, and repeatable.

Think of it like a “formula” for your prompt.

Instead of writing random text, you follow a framework to tell the AI:
What role to take
What task to do
What style to follow
What format to return

 Prompting Frameworks You Should Know
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are 5 most effective prompting frameworks used in Generative AI work 👇

🧩 1. R.I.S.E Framework

(Best for general-purpose prompts)

R.I.S.E = Role – Instruction – Steps – Example

Component	Description	Example
Role	Tell the AI who it is	You are a Python tutor.
Instruction	What to do	Explain list comprehension in Python.
Steps	How to do it	Explain step-by-step with code example.
Example	Optional example	Show one example using numbers.

✅ Prompt Example:

You are a Python tutor.
Explain list comprehension in Python step-by-step with a simple example using numbers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 2. C.R.E.A.T.E Framework

(Used for creative content writing)

C.R.E.A.T.E = Context – Role – Example – Audience – Tone – Expectation

Example:

Context: Writing an Instagram caption about AI innovation.
Role: Act as a tech influencer.
Audience: Young professionals.
Tone: Exciting and informative.
Expectation: Give 3 catchy captions.

✅ Helps the model understand the situation + audience + tone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧱 3. P.R.O.M.P.T Framework

(Structured for technical tasks or documentation)

P.R.O.M.P.T = Purpose – Role – Output – Mode – Parameters – Tone

Element	Example
Purpose	Generate test cases for a login feature.
Role	You are a QA automation engineer.
Output	Output as a table with test case ID, Description, Expected Result.
Mode	Manual test cases only.
Parameters	3 positive, 2 negative scenarios.
Tone	Professional and concise.

✅ This framework is perfect for testers, developers, and technical AI users.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧮 4. CoT (Chain-of-Thought) Framework

(For reasoning or analytical tasks)

This framework encourages the AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step before answering.

Example:

Let’s solve this step-by-step.
A train travels 120 km in 3 hours. What’s the speed?

AI Response 👇

Step 1: Speed = Distance / Time = 120 / 3 = 40 km/h.
Final Answer: 40 km/h.

✅ Use this when you want the AI to reason, not just give a direct answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
💬 5. T.A.S.K Framework

(For clarity and control in single-task prompts)

T.A.S.K = Task – Audience – Style – Knowledge

Example:

Task: Explain blockchain in simple words.
Audience: High school students.
Style: Conversational.
Knowledge: Use real-life examples.

✅ Works best for education, explanations, and communication tasks.

#### **SWOT — Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats**


A strategic planning framework that can be adapted to AI prompting to analyze situations or decisions.

Formula: Analyze [Strengths], acknowledge [Weaknesses], explore and consider [Opportunities], and consider [Threats].

Example: Analyze someone aiming to advance in the field of [insert career field]. Consider [Strengths] such as existing skills and experience, [Weaknesses] that include gaps in the resume, [Opportunities] for professional development, and (Threats] like market saturation.

**Prompt** 

> Analyze someone aiming to advance in the field of Software testing and Test Automation. Consider I have knowledge of Selenium, API Testing, Manual Testing such as existing skills and experience, Mobile Testing, Security, Performance Testing that include gaps in the resume, Automation lead for professional development, and AI, Automation Tools coming to like market saturation. Give me the roadmap to become a Job Ready Automation Tester in python for 3-4 months with CI/CD in tabular format month by month and topics to add more to stay relevant in IT.

#### **STAR — Situation-Task-Action-Result** 
- Often used in behavioral interview contexts.
Formula: Describe [Situation], outline the [Task] taken, and share the [Result]



Example: In a declining market [Situation], my task is to maintain sales volume [Task]. What are the possible initiatives [Actions], to retain the majority of our customers base [Result].



> In a declining market Manual Tester, my task is to maintain stay relevant into the QA role. What are the possible initiatives I can take to retain my role in QA.

#### CLEAR — Challenge-Limitation-Effect-Action-Result
This is used to identify challenges, explain limitations, suggest possible actions, and anticipate future outcomes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Formula: Identify a [challenge], acknowledge a [Limitation], predict the [Effect], propose an [Action], and envisage the [Result].

Example: The challenge of declining user engagement [Challenge], limited by our current platform capabilities [Limitation], leads to lower retention [Effect], what upgrades to our platform [Action] will increase engagement [Result].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### **PAR — Problem-Action-Result**
Often used in behavioral interview contexts but focuses on problem-solving scenarios.

Formula: State the [Problem], describe the [Action] taken, and reveal the [Result]

Example: Facing the problem of high employee attrition [Problem], how to introduce an employee engagement program [Action], to increase retention quickly [Result]
