🧠 1️⃣ What is Generative AI?
💡 Definition:

Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) is a branch of AI that can create 
new content — such as text, images, music, code, or videos — by learning patterns from
existing data.

👉 Instead of just analyzing or classifying data, it generates something new.

🧩 Example:
Input	                                                 Output
“Write a poem about sunrise.”                	 A new poem never seen before
“Generate an image of a robot reading a book.”	 A brand-new AI image
“Write Python code to sort numbers.”	       Original code generated by the model
💬 In short:

Generative AI doesn’t just understand — it creates

⚙️ 2️⃣ AI vs ML vs Deep Learning vs Generative AI
Concept	Meaning	Example
AI (Artificial Intelligence) =	The broad field where machines mimic human intelligence.	A chatbot answering questions.

ML (Machine Learning) =	A subset of AI that uses data to learn patterns and make predictions.	A spam filter learning from emails.

Deep Learning =	A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns.	Image recognition or speech-to-text.

Generative AI = A type of deep learning model that creates new data (text, image, audio, etc.) based on what it has learned.	ChatGPT writing essays, DALL·E generating images.

### What is LLM?
- An **LLM** usually refers to a **Large Language Model** in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
- An LLM is an AI system **trained on massive amounts of text data** to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.


**Examples**:

1. OpenAI’s GPT models --    **Powers ChatGPT; advanced conversational model**
2. Google’s Gemini        -- Multimodal (handles text, image, audio)
3. Anthropic’s Claude   --   Strong in reasoning and long-text understanding
4. Meta’s LLaMA       --     Open-source LLM used in research and development
5. DeepSeek
6. Grok 4
7. Mistral             --      Lightweight, high-performance models for developers

- Curated way to access the LLMs. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**How LLMs Work (Simplified):**
- It learns patterns in language (words, grammar, meaning, style) from billions of sentences.
- Then **it predicts the next word** (or token) in a sequence, which allows it to generate coherent text, answer questions, summarize, translate, write code, etc.
## ****
Input (Prompt): You give a request → “Explain black holes.”
Tokenization: Text is broken into smaller pieces (tokens).
Processing: The model uses transformers (attention layers) to understand meaning.
Output: It predicts the next words to generate a full response.
