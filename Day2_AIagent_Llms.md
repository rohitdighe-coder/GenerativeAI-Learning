### AI Agent vs LLM ###

### 🔹 **LLM (Large Language Model)**
- Acts like a brain that understands and generates natural language.
- Capabilities:
Answering questions
Writing text/code
Summarizing
Translation, Image , Video Gen.
- Limitations:
Works in a stateless way — it predicts and generates words but doesn’t inherently “take actions” or manage tasks.

### 🔹 AI Agent
**What it is:**
A system (or program) that uses an LLM + additional tools to take actions, make decisions, and achieve goals.

> AI AGENT = LLM + Tools + Memory 
> Learn, Adapt and Optimize.

Wraps around the LLM and gives it memory, goals, and the ability to interact with the real world.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Capabilities**:

- Can plan multi-step tasks
- Use APIs, databases, or software tools
- Remember past interactions
- Automate workflows (e.g., book a ticket, test software, send emails)

**⚡ Simple Analogy**

LLM = A brilliant student who knows everything in theory.

AI Agent = That student equipped with a to-do list, calendar, phone, and the ability to get things done in the real world.
