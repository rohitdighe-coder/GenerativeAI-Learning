# 🧠Prompt Engineering Techniques ##


### What is Prompting , How to learn?
- Prompting refers to the practice of providing **specific instructions or input to an artificial intelligence (AI) model to obtain desired responses. **
- In the context of AI and language models like GPT-4, prompting **involves crafting queries or statements that guide the model to generate useful and relevant outputs.**

------------------------------------------------------
**Rule for the Prompts**

1. **Start Simple: **Begin with basic prompts to see how the model responds. For example, ask straightforward questions or give simple instructions.
2. **Refine Y**our Prompts: Experiment with different wordings, lengths, and structures. Notice how changes in the prompt affect the output. Add examples.
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously tweak your prompts based on the results you get. Aim for clarity and specificity to achieve more accurate responses.

Zero-Shot Prompting
💡 Meaning:

Zero-shot prompting means you ask the AI to do a task directly — without giving it any example of what kind of answer you expect.

You simply describe what you want in the prompt.
The AI uses its training knowledge to figure out how to answer.

📘 Example:

Prompt:
"Write a poem about the moon in 4 lines."

🧠 The AI has never seen your example, but it knows what a poem is, what the moon is, and how to create a response.

Output (AI generates directly):
The moonlight dances on the sea,
A mirror of eternity,
It whispers secrets to the night,
Soft silver dreams in quiet light.

✅ Used when:

The task is simple or common (like writing, explaining, summarizing).

You want quick results without examples.

🟡 Few-Shot Prompting
💡 Meaning:

Few-shot prompting means you give the AI a few examples (2–3) before asking it to do your task.
This helps the model understand the pattern or style you expect.

It’s like showing the AI a few sample questions and answers before it solves a new one.

📘 Example:
Example 1:
Input: Translate "Hello" to French.  
Output: Bonjour

Example 2:
Input: Translate "Good night" to French.  
Output: Bonne nuit

Now translate "Thank you" to French.


Output:
Merci

✅ Used when:

You want the AI to follow a specific format or tone.
The task has a pattern (like translations, summaries, code examples).
You want more controlled and consistent answers.

Zero-Shot	Like asking someone a question without any context — they answer based on their general knowledge.
Few-Shot	Like showing someone a few solved examples before asking them to solve a new one in the same style.
